### **Drunkeness in different district over 15 years**
Sometimes we want to look at crime from year to year to see if the level of security in the district has increased or decreased. A line chart is a good choice because everyone can clearly see the trend and change of the line.

With the line plot below, We could see changes in the total number of drunkenness committed each year in different district over 15 years. You can chose to hide one district or some of the districts by clicking the specific legends.

This graph is a line chart that reveals annual crime by district in San Francisco. Crime in the Southern district has been at a relatively high level, with a spike in crime in particular in 2013. By contrast, Richmond and Ingleside districts have consistently recorded low levels of crime, reflecting their relative safety and comfort.

As Richmond and Ingleside districts with many quiet residential areas, these two districts have a large number of residents with stable incomes, and their taxes can be fed back into the community security, forming a positive cycle, which is a possible factor in keeping the crime rate low. 

While it's not the same in the Southern district. The Southern district covers many different communities, Bayview, Bernal Heights, Dogpatch, Excelsior, Ingleside, Mission, Potrero Hill, Visitacion Valley, and more. Rates of violent crime and property crime are relatively high in these communities. The reason for this phenomenon is that some neighborhoods in the Southern district are poorer neighborhoods, and the residents in these neighborhoods may be more commonly faced with problems such as unemployment and poverty, which directly lead to increased crime rates. In the long run, the culture of violence may become more common, and some young people may be easily affected by violent behaviors, leading to a rise in crime rate, too.
