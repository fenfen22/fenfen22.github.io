 Crime in the Southern District was at a relatively high level, with a spike in crime in particular in 2013. By contrast, Richmond and Ingleside districts have consistently recorded low levels of crime, reflecting their relative safety and comfort. 

When one looks at the trend of drunkenness incidents in each district we see that from 2006 to 2007 and from 2012 to 2013 there was a 50% increase in events in the Mission district (*east of Twin Peaks to the James Lick Freeway, and south of Market Street to Cesar Chavez Street*).

This is not the case in the Southern District (*includes the Ferry Building, continuing south from Mission Street to Mariposa Street and east to the Bay, South of Mission, Embarcadero, and China Basin areas)*. In this district from 2006 to 2007, there is a slight decline in events, but a steep increase of more than 100% in incidents between 2012 and 2013.

The Tenderloin district (*area bordered by Geary, Market, and Larkin streets*), has a steady pattern until 2007, an increase of over 100% until 2009, followed by a decline and another rise of incidents from 2012 to 2013.
A closer comparison of the cumulative number of incidents in 2015, 2016 and 2017 shows a decrease in events in the Mission, Southern and Central districts, but a slight increase in 2016 in the Tenderloin district. In general, in 2017 we see a decline in drunkenness incidents in all of the districts, but keep in mind that the 2017 data used in this analysis includes incidents up until November 5th. However, with the end-of-the-year holidays around the corner, we should expect an increase in events.
