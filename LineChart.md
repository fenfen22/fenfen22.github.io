### **Drunkeness in different district over 15 years**
Sometimes we want to look at crime from year to year to see if the level of security in the district has increased or decreased. With the line plot below, We could see changes in the total number of drunkenness committed each year in different district over 15 years. You can chose to hide one district or some of the districts by clicking the specific legends.

 Crime in the Southern district was at a relatively high level, with a spike in crime in particular in 2013. By contrast, Richmond and Ingleside districts have consistently recorded low levels of crime, reflecting their relative safety and comfort. 

When one looks at the trend of drunkenness incidents on each district we see that from 2006 to 2007 and from 2012 to 2013 there was a 50% increase of events in the Mission district (*east of Twin Peaks to the James Lick Freeway, and south of Market Street to Cesar Chavez Street*).

This is not the case in the Southern district (*includes the Ferry Building, continuing south from Mission Street to Mariposa Street and east to the Bay, South of Mission, Embarcadero, and China Basin areas)*. In this district from 2006 to 2007 there is a slight decline of events, but a steep increase of more than 100% incidents from 2012 and 2013.

The Tenderloin district (*area bordered by Geary, Market, and Larkin streets*), has a steady pattern until 2007, an increase of over 100% until 2009, followed by a decline and another rise of incidents from 2012 to 2013.
A closer comparison of the cumulative number of incidents in 2015, 2016 and 2017 shows a decrease of events in the Mission, Southern and Central districts, but a slight increase in 2016 in the Tenderloin district. In general, in 2017 we see a decline of drunkenness incidents in all of the districts, but keep in mind that the 2017 data used in this analysis includes incidents up until November 5th. However, with the end of the year holidays around the corner we should expect an increase in events.

As Richmond and Ingleside districts with many quiet residential areas, these two districts have a large number of residents with stable incomes, and their taxes can be fed back into the community security, forming a positive cycle, which is a possible factor in keeping the crime rate low. 

While it's not the same in the Southern district. The Southern district covers many different communities, Bayview, Bernal Heights, Dogpatch, Excelsior, Ingleside, Mission, Potrero Hill, Visitacion Valley, and more. Rates of violent crime and property crime are relatively high in these communities. The reason for this phenomenon is that some neighborhoods in the Southern district are poorer neighborhoods, and the residents in these neighborhoods may be more commonly faced with problems such as unemployment and poverty, which directly lead to increased crime rates. In the long run, the culture of violence may become more common, and some young people may be easily affected by violent behaviors, leading to a rise in crime rate, too.
