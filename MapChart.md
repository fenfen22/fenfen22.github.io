According to the choropleth map, the Richmond district appears to have the darkest colour, indicating that it has the lowest number of drunkenness, which is 352. In contrast, the Southern district appears to have the lightest colour, indicating that it has the highest number of drunkenness, which is 2122. The figure does not account for the size of the district.

According to the statistics of the number of occurrences, it could be considered that the district in Southern San Francisco has a higher rate of drunkenness-related crimes. There are multiple possible factors, since Southern San Francisco has a large number of bars and nightclubs, for example, it may attract people who are more likely to engage in excessive drinking and related behaviours. In addition, the demographics of the Southern district, such as age and income, may contribute to a higher rate of alcohol abuse and related crimes. Furthermore, since this is probably an area of mixed culture, perhaps some of these cultural attitudes towards alcohol or access to alcohol, contribute to a higher rate of drunkenness-related crimes in the Southern district.
