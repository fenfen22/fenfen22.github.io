### **Introduction**

[San Francisco crime dataset](https://datasf.org/opendata) from 2003 to May 2018 has been chosen for analysing in this article. To be more specific, we only considered crime data from 2003 to 2017 in our report because the crime data of 2018 is incomplete in this dataset. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed through the [SFPD's website](https://www.sanfranciscopolice.org).

The total number of crimes in this dataset is 2129525, the average number of crimes per year is 133095.3125. The dataset includes [various attributes](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry) such as the incident time, the location of the incident, the type of crime committed, the police district where the incident occurred, the victim's demographic information and so on. 

In this article, we chose to analyze the drunkenness aspect of the San Francisco crime dataset. One of reason is drunkenness can lead to a variety of dangerous and potentially harmful behaviors, such as driving under this case or engaging in violent or disorderly conduct. Analyzing the incidence of drunkenness can help to identify areas or times of day where public safety may be at risk, and inform efforts to prevent and reduce these types of crimes. Another reason is analyzing the incidence of drunkenness-related crimes can provide insights into the criminal justice system's response to these types of offenses, including the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts, the outcomes of criminal cases, and the impact of penalties on offenders and their communities[^1].
